### Summer 2024
Hey all! I just wanted to update you guys with what I've been up to since I graduated. I've been waiting (and still waiting) to get my OPT to be authorized, and that puts some time on my hands to do different things. I did travel with my family who saw me and my brother graduate doing road trips around the US, and I’ve also been having fun playing amateur baseball in South Dakota. I’ve also been actively looking for jobs so I could start to work right away, which hopefully will happen soon. Lastly, I also started working on a personal project so that I can use some of the knowledge I gained from my Master’s Degree to use.

This project is based on a baseball concept of Hip-Shoulder separation. My goal was to try and validate the concept by using biomechanics data from Driveline. I do have a passion of player development and believe that data like this could benefit us in terms of understanding how to improve players. Even though I have not worked with biomechanics data before, I thought that I can still showcase my data analytics knowledge I learned since I also have some baseball knowledge being a player. 

I think the toughest thing I faced in this project is finding a problem that can be solved using the data. After hearing some of the Driveline R&D Podcasts, I realized that I have to think creatively and analytically when trying to use biomechanics data with the intentions of furthering player development. Once that’s solved, then using the data and analyzing them is the fun part!

I’ve learned a lot doing this project. I don’t mean just the technical skills, but also my problem-solving skills and time management skills. Most of all, I learned to follow through and produce a project that is not too simple or too complicated to understand. Adjusting from being a collegiate athlete to doing something like this is tough, but I learned that I can do it.

I will share my GitHub link down below so y’all can see the code and the write up. Any feedback is appreciated!

PS: I’m also planning to continue this project further, as I think I could do more validation of the concept by correlating it with other metrics within the data, so I will be working on that next!
